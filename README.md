  <h2>Free your dehumidifier from the cloud ‚Äî now with ESPHome</h2>
</div>
# Update 24/10/2025, in this release:

* üÜï Added beep, sleep, pump switches + Capabilities text

* Fixed switches turning off if device is off

* ‚öôÔ∏è General background and stability improvements


This project is an **ESPHome-based port** of [Hypfer‚Äôs esp8266-midea-dehumidifier](https://github.com/Hypfer/esp8266-midea-dehumidifier).  
While the original version used a custom MQTT firmware, this one is a **native ESPHome component**, providing full **Home Assistant integration** without MQTT or cloud dependencies.

## ‚ú® Features

This component allows you to directly control and monitor Midea-based dehumidifiers via UART, completely bypassing the Midea cloud dongle.

Supported entities:

| Entity Type     | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Climate**      | Power, mode, fan speed, and presets |
| **Binary Sensor (optional)** | "Bucket Full" indicator |
| **Error Sensor (optional)** | Reports current error code (optional in YAML) |
| **ION Switch (optional)** | Controls ionizer state if supported |
| **Swing Switch (optional)** | Controls swing if supported |
| **Beep Switch (optional)** | Controls buzzer on ha commands if supported |
| **Sleep Switch (optional)** | Controls sleep switch if supported |
| **Pump Switch (optional)** | Controls pump if supported |
| **Timer Number (optional)** | Controls the internal device timer if supported |
| **Capabilities Text (optional)** | Shows device capabilities info |

Optional entities can be included or excluded simply by adding or omitting them from your YAML.

## üß† Background

Midea-made dehumidifiers (sold under brands like *Inventor*, *Comfee*, *Midea*, etc.) use a UART-based protocol behind their ‚ÄúWiFi SmartKey‚Äù dongles.

Those dongles wrap simple serial communication in cloud encryption and authentication layers.  
By connecting directly to the UART pins inside the unit, you can fully control it locally ‚Äî no cloud, no reverse proxy, no token handshakes.

---

## üß© Compatibility

These models are confirmed to work (and more likely will, too):

* Midea MAD22S1WWT  
* Comfee MDDF-16DEN7-WF  
* Comfee MDDF-20DEN7-WF
* Comfee CDDF7-16DEN7-WFI
* Inventor Eva II PRO Wi-Fi  
* Inventor EVA ION PRO Wi-Fi 20L  
* Midea Cube 20 / 35 / 50  

Models without USB or Wi-Fi button (e.g., Comfee MDDF-20DEN7) could also work with small wiring changes.

---

## üß∞ Hardware Setup

You‚Äôll need:

* **ESP32** (or ESP8266) board
  
* **UART connection** (TX/RX) to your dehumidifier‚Äôs USB A female adapter (i.e. male USB A adapter with pins for connection see following photo)
 
![17605125491072937899494889157102](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/166900a0-045f-42d4-80bc-405f7af4ed5c)

* **3.3 V ‚Üî 5 V level shifting** (if necessary)

The Midea WiFi dongle is just a UART-to-cloud bridge ‚Äî unplug it and connect your ESP board instead:

| Dongle Pin | Function | ESP Pin Example |
|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | 5 V | VIN |
| 2 | TX | GPIO17 |
| 3 | RX | GPIO16 |
| 4 | GND | GND |

  status_poll_interval: 30000 # Optional, how often should ESP ask the device for a status update in ms (1000ms=1sec). Default: 30000ms

  # üÜï Optional: Rename display modes to match your device‚Äôs front panel.
  # For example, your unit may label these as ‚ÄúCont‚Äù, ‚ÄúDry‚Äù, or ‚ÄúSmart‚Äù.
  # These names only affect how the presets appear in Home Assistant ‚Äî 
  # the internal logic and protocol remain the same.

  # üí° Tip:
  # If any of the modes below are set to "UNUSED" (case-insensitive),
  # that preset will NOT appear in the Home Assistant UI.
  # Use this if your device doesn‚Äôt support or respond to a specific mode.
  # For instance, if pressing ‚ÄúSMART‚Äù, your unit doesn't change any mode,
  # set display_mode_smart: "UNUSED" to hide it from the UI.

  display_mode_setpoint: 'UNUSED'      # Hidden in Home Assistant (disabled)
  display_mode_continuous: 'Cont'      # Shown as "Cont"

# Optional beep control
# When enabled, the device will emit a beep sound when it receives
# commands (e.g. from Home Assistant or OTA updates).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Notice

Many of these dehumidifiers use R290 (Propane) as refrigerant.
This gas is flammable. Be extremely careful when opening or modifying your unit.
Avoid sparks, heat, or metal contact that could pierce the sealed system.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This project interacts directly with hardware inside a mains-powered appliance that may use R290 (propane) refrigerant.
Modifying or opening such devices can be dangerous and may cause electric shock, fire, or injury if not done safely.

By using this project, you agree that:

You perform all modifications at your own risk.

The author(s) and contributors are not responsible for any damage, data loss, or injury.

Always disconnect power before working on the device.

Never operate the unit open or modified near flammable materials.

If you‚Äôre not confident working with electrical components, don‚Äôt attempt this modification.
